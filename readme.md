# Testing
- # 1 Unit Testing
- - as the name suggest what it ment by youre writing so much code and you pick a small unit and insure that one single unit working perfectly or not
- ex: car bolt is working not 

# Popular Interview Topics?
- Write code for given test cases
- How to test a given utility
- E2E Test case scenarious
- Test Your own code

- # 2 Component Testing

- # 3 Integration Testing:
- - we have a large application built by small components this small components work together when we testing the whole feat is working together or not flow => integration of multiple components

- # Function testing:
- - functionality from end-user perspective
- - It means we take flipkart app add to cart(button) when user click the button it will update in the cart in the cart number in change to 1
- # A/B Testing
- - 

- # Test Driven Developemnt

- # E2E Testing:
- - testing the whole flow of the appliation
- - Ex: take flipkart app the user landed at the home and user to click the product and in product page user to click the add cart and in cart in page the user to click procced to payment it goes Login the entir flow user journy user navigate to out of appliction is known as e2e
- Cypress, selenium, Playwright

- # Regression Testing:
- - whenever we build application , we don't build whole application in one day
- - Ex: suppose we building amazon.com  is not build in one day or it not final version the seing right now , every day some other features are adding the website application
we lunch the first version of website the we will add more feature going days
when adding new featurs in older version is not breaks it means the existing code doesn't break is known as RET



- # Performance Testing:
- - Page loads speed, how heavy our page is, how mach data we transfering depending on that 
- - loading the web page , how much time become interacted webpage ,

- # Accessibility Testing:
- - ensures that the application is usable by people with disabilities and compiles

- # Cross-Browser Testing:
- - paytm - application's compatibility and functionality across the differnt web browsers

- # Usability Testing:
- - end user interact with our application , how the navigate through the application means manually testing

- # Security testing: 
- - we have differnt module on diffent mode go check that module out there are so many security threads app can have

- # Localization and Internationalization Testing:
- application works correctly in different languages and regions.

- # A/B Testing:
- - also known as split testing. 
- - amazon.com  which offers it is product call manager when to call this features

- # TDD
- - stands for Test-Driven Developemnt
- - means that is techine before write the code we write test cases
- - firstly we wirte test cases and after we write the actual code

# Key Points
- # what is Javascript:
    - is a High level, interpreted Programming language
    - used to create interactive and dynamic web content
    - lightweight ad event-driven language 
    - it can run on both the client and servers sides

- # data type supported
    - Number
    - String
    - Boolean
    - Undefined
    - Object

- # let and const and var
    - var - function-scoped, hoisted
    - let - Block-scoped, hoitsed but not intialized
    - const - Block-scoped, must be initialed suring declaration

- # == and === differ
    - == checks for value equality with type coercion
    - === checks for strict equality without type coercion

- # Closure

- # hoisting

- # this keyword

- # protytypes

- # diff null and undefined
    - null - A deliberate non-value
    - undefined - A variable declared but not assigned a value

- # JS handle async operation
    - callbacks
    - Promises
    - async/await

- # Promise
    - 

- # async/await functions

- # event delegation
    - allows you to handle events for multiple child elements at the parent level

- # JS modules
    - allow you to organize code into reusable file using import and export

- # How can you prevent a function from being called multiple times?
    -   debounce function

- # JS Event loop
    - the event loop continuously checks the call stack and the task queue, executing tasks from the queue when the stack is empty

- # diff apply() and call() and bind()
    - 

- # event bubbling and event capturing
    -   Event Bubbling: Events propagete from the target element to the parent elemets
    - Event Capturing: Events progate from the parent elemets to the target elemts

- # diff deep copy and shallow copy
    - Shallow copy: Copies only the first layer of an object
    - Deep Copy : Copies all layers of an object

- # generator functions
    - spe fun
    - pause execution and resme later
    - function* generator(){
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
        yield 3;
    }
    - o/p - 1 , 2

- # new Keyword
    - new keyword create an instance of a object from a contructor function

- # setTimeout and setInterval
    - setTimeout: Executes a function after a specified delay
    - setInterval: Repeats excution at specified intervals

- # WeakMap and Map
    - map : Keys can be any type

- # Set 
    - A Set is collection of unique values

- # Object.create():
    - It creates a new Object with a spefiend protype.

- # garbage collection
    - uses mark-and-sweep alg to identify and remove unused objects

- # Decorators
    - are functions that modify classes or methods - experiemental feat:
    - @decorator

- # diffe prototype and __proto__
    - protytype: An object associated with functoion for inheritance
    - __proto__: A reference to the object's prototype
